## A few useful tips...

- The [configuration]() methods are useful to get the static lists of data we use throughout the database. 
You can find things like the languages, countries, timezones and translations that we use. The configuration method also holds useful image information.
- Understanding the basics of our authentication is useful. You can read about this [here]().
- We enforce some amount of rate limiting on the API. You can read about that [here]().
