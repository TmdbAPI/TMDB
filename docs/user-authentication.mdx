## How it works

User authentication is one of the authentication methods available to our API users. It allows our application's users to access, edit, or write to their account directly from your app. 
The steps on how to do this are outlined in this guide. Read more about other authentication methods [here]().



### Step 1: Create a request token
A `request_token` is a temporary token that is required to ask a TMDB user for permission to access their account. This token will auto expire after 60 minutes if it's not used.
It will be used to request a user's permission to access their TMDB account. 

You will be issued a `session-id` that can now be used to write user data if the permission is granted. 

The [create request token]() endpoint is used to generate a `request_token`.

### Step 2: Authenticate the request token
The `request_token` created in the previous step needs to be authenticated before it can be used to generate a `session_id`. With a `request_token` in hand, forward your user to the 
following URL:

```
https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{REQUEST_TOKEN}
```
You can also pass this URL a `redirect_to` parameter, i.e:

```
https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{REQUEST_TOKEN}?redirect_to=http://www.yourapp.com/approved
```

This url will open up a page on the TMDB website requesting their permission to grant your app access to their account. Once the user has approved, 
they will either be redirected to the URL you specified in the `redirect_to` parameter or to the `/authenticate/allow` path on TMDB.


### Step 3: Create a session id
The [create session id]() endpoint is used to create a new session id for a user. By calling the new session method with the request token that has been approved by the user, 
we will return a new `session_id`. 

This is the session that can now be used to perform actions on behalf of the user such as, rate movies, create lists, etc. 

<Note>You should treat this key like a password and keep it secret.</Note>


## Alternative method

You can also validate a `request_token` using the user's account credentials (username and password). This will replace *Step 2* above. 

Not all application have access to a web view so this can be used as a substitute. The [validate request token (with Login)]() endpoint is used to do this and it requires
the TMDB user's account username and password. 

The validated `request_token` will be returned in the response and can be used in Step 3 above.

<Note>The preferred method of validating a request token is to have a user authenticate the request via the TMDB website. However, If you decide to use this method
please use HTTPS.</Note>
