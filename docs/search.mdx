A common workflow here on TMDB is to search for a movie (or TV show, or person) and then query for the details. Here's a quick overview of what that flow looks like.

## Search
First, you are going to issue a query to one of the movie, TV show or person search methods. We'll use Jack Reacher and the movie method for this example:

```bash Example Search Request
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?query=Jack+Reacher' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

This will return a few fields, the one you want to look at is the results field. This is an array and will contain our standard movie list objects. 
Here's an example of the first item:

```json Example Results Object
{  
  "poster_path": "/IfB9hy4JH1eH6HEfIgIGORXi5h.jpg",  
  "adult": false,  
  "overview": "Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name. On the run as a fugitive from the law, Reacher uncovers a potential secret from his past that could change his life forever.",  
  "release_date": "2016-10-19",  
  "genre_ids": [  
    53,  
    28,  
    80,  
    18,  
    9648  
  ],  
  "id": 343611,  
  "original_title": "Jack Reacher: Never Go Back",  
  "original_language": "en",  
  "title": "Jack Reacher: Never Go Back",  
  "backdrop_path": "/4ynQYtSEuU5hyipcGkfD6ncwtwz.jpg",  
  "popularity": 26.818468,  
  "vote_count": 201,  
  "video": false,  
  "vote_average": 4.19  
}
```

## Query For Details
With the item above in hand, you can see the id of the movie is 343611. You can use that id to query the movie details method:

```bash Example Details Query
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/343611' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

This will return all of the main movie details as outlined in the movie details documentation. I would also suggest taking a read through the append to response document as it
outlines how you can make multiple sub requests in one. For example, with videos:

```bash Example Append Request
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11?append_to_response=videos' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
```
