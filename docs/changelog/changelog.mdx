<Update label="2025-02-25" description="Migration to Mintlify">
    The TMDB documentation is migrated to Mintlify as a personal project by Edun Rilwan. 
    This is not an official migration by the team at TMDB. This is merely a personal project and should not be seen as a replacement for the actual TMDB documentation.

<Update label="almost 2 years ago by Travis Bell" description="Migration Complete!">
    Thanks for being patient as I worked through getting our docs migrated to ReadMe. 
    At this point I believe every method has been added and is present here. 
    I'll be cleaning up some of the links and copy over the next little while but everything is looking good and is representative of our API.

    We've started the process of migrating our API docs to ReadMe. 
    Please be patient and give us some time to get this completed. 
    I'll update this post when things are further along.
