[The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) is a community built movie and TV database. Our database holds a large record of millions of movies and TV shows worldwide. 
Every piece of data has been added by our amazing community dating back to 2008. 

TMDB's strong international focus and breadth of data is largely unmatched and something we're 
incredibly proud of. Put simply, we live and breathe community and that's precisely what makes us different.

Our API gives you access to our entire movie database. We provide you with 100+ endpoints to query the API for movie-related information, rate movies, like movies, etc for both personal and
commercial use. Learn more [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/about).
