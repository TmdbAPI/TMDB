If you're interested in keeping track of the changes as they happen on TMDB, we have designed the **change** system to help with this. 
There are two aspects to this: first, tracking which ID's were changed and then second, calling those individual changes.

## Tracking changed IDs
There are three main endpoints you can call to get a list of recently changed IDs. They include:

- [Movie changes](https://emiloju.mintlify.app/api-reference/recent-changes/get-recently-changed-movies)
- [Person changes](https://emiloju.mintlify.app/api-reference/recent-changes/get-recently-changed-persons)
- [TV changes](https://emiloju.mintlify.app/api-reference/recent-changes/get-recently-changed-tv-shows). 

These endpoints will return a list of items that have been changed in the past 24 hours (by default but can be extended to 14 days) and their IDs. 
With an ID in hand, you can then call the individual item's change history.

## Calling individual changes by ID
If you have an ID in hand, you can call any of the media ID change endpoints (here's [movies](https://emiloju.mintlify.app/api-reference/movies/get-latest-changes) for example.) 
This call will then return the actual field level data that was changed, just like our public change logs you can find on the website. 
You can either consume these changes in their entirety, or selective grab the data that is important to you.

It's generally a good idea to stay in sync with our changes so you can display the most up to date and accurate information
