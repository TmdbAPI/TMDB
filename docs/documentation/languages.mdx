TMDB tries to be localized wherever possible. While most of our metadata endpoints support translated data, there are still a few gaps that do not. 
The two main areas that are not are person names and characters. We're working to support this.

## ISO 639-1
The language code system we use is [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). 
Unfortunately, there are a number of languages that don't have a ISO-639-1 representation.
We may decide to upgrade to ISO-639-3 in the future but do not have any immediate plans to do so.

## ISO 3166-1
You'll usually find our language codes mated to a country code in the format of `en-US`. The country codes in use here are [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).


<Note>
Images do not yet support the `language-COUNTRY` notation. This will be improved in the future. 
Take a read through the image language [documentation](https://emiloju.mintlify.app/image_language) to learn how to partly get around this limitation.

Now that you know how languages work, let's look at some example requests.

```bash English Example
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/tv/1399?language=en-US' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

```bash Portuguese Example
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?language=pt-BR' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```
